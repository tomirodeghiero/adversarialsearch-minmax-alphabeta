# Min Max and Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of the Min Max and Min Max Alpha Beta algorithms, designed specifically for academic purposes at the Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto (UNRC). These implementations are part of the coursework for the subjects "Diseño de Algoritmos" (3326) and "Algortimos II" (3302).

## Creator

- **Tomás Rodeghiero** - Initial work and implementation of the Min Max and Min Max Alpha Beta algorithms.

## Overview

The project includes a straightforward implementation of these classic decision-making algorithms used in game theory and artificial intelligence to calculate the best move for a player assuming that the opponent also plays optimally.

## Files

- `app.js` - Contains the JavaScript implementation of the algorithms.
- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the web interface.
- `app.css` - Styling for the web interface.
- `README.md` - Provides project details and setup instructions.
- `LICENSE` - The license file.
- `unrc.png` - Image associated with UNRC.

## Usage

To run the project, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in a browser. No additional setup is required.
